===================
Introduction to Statistical Analysis.

This course provides a refresher on the foundations of statistical analysis. Practicals are conducted using the ‘Shiny’ package; which provides an accessible interface to the R statistical language.

Note that this is not a course for learning about the R statistical language itself. If you wish to learn more about R, please see other courses at the University of Cambridge ( An Introduction to Solving Biological Problems with R ).

Aims
====
During this course you will learn about:

    Assumptions of one-sample and two-sample t-tests
    Interpreting the result of a statistical test
    Statistical tests of categorical variables (Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests)
    Non-parametric versions of one- and two-sample tests (Wilcoxon tests)

We will not cover ANOVA or linear regression here but these are the topics of a more advanced course

Learning Objectives

After this course you should be able to:-
    State the assumptions required for a one-sample and two-sample t-test and be able to interpret the results of such a test
    Know when to apply a paired or independent two-sample t-test
    To perform simple statistical calculations using the online app
    Understand the limitations of the tests taught within the course
    Know when more complex statistical methods are required
